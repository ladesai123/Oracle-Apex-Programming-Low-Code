## 📖 Course Overview

Welcome to the **Oracle APEX Programming - Low-Code Course**! This comprehensive course is designed to teach you how to build powerful, scalable web applications using Oracle Application Express (APEX) with minimal traditional coding. Through hands-on examples and practical exercises, you'll learn to leverage SQL and PL/SQL to create enterprise-grade applications quickly and efficiently.

## 🎯 What is Oracle APEX?

Oracle Application Express (APEX) is a low-code development platform that enables you to build scalable, secure enterprise web applications with minimal coding. APEX applications run on Oracle Database and can be deployed on-premises, in the cloud, or in hybrid environments.

### Key Benefits:
- **Rapid Development**: Build applications 10x faster than traditional coding
- **Enterprise Security**: Built-in security features and authentication
- **Scalability**: Runs on Oracle Database infrastructure
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first applications out of the box
- **SQL/PL-SQL Integration**: Leverage existing database skills

## 🚀 Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- ✅ Understand Oracle APEX architecture and components
- ✅ Create and deploy web applications using low-code approaches
- ✅ Design responsive user interfaces with APEX components
- ✅ Implement business logic using SQL and PL/SQL
- ✅ Manage application security and user authentication
- ✅ Integrate with REST APIs and external data sources

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Option 1: Oracle Cloud Free Tier (Recommended)
1. Sign up for Oracle Cloud Free Tier: https://cloud.oracle.com/free
2. Create an Autonomous Database instance
3. Access APEX from the database tools
4. Start building your first application

4. Access APEX through your local browser

### Quick Setup Commands:
```sql
-- Connect to your Oracle Database
-- Create APEX workspace (if not already created)
BEGIN
    APEX_INSTANCE_ADMIN.ADD_WORKSPACE(
        p_workspace => 'LEARNING_APEX',
        p_primary_schema => 'APEX_USER',
        p_additional_schemas => 'HR'
    );
END;
/

-- Create sample tables for exercises
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR2(50),
    last_name VARCHAR2(50),
    email VARCHAR2(100),
    hire_date DATE,
    salary NUMBER(8,2)
);
```
